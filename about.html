                <h2>Learning a Language</h2>
                <a href="#recipe" class="skip-link">Skip to Recipe</a>
            </div>
            <p>As an adult, or without the support of an education system, self learning comes with a lot of pitfalls in language education. You don't know what you don't know, and you can't assess the advice you are given with any discernment. When you add to that the in-your-face reality of suddenly needing a new language, getting off of the ground can be very taxing on your energy and your ability to function.</p>

            <p>I have tried many methods to teach myself leading up to international adventures, and it was always worth the effort, but I was never ready. Now, I have gone through the learning. A few times. And I am a language educator. I know what is needed.</p>

            <p>FlashBoss turns language acquisition from an impossible <span class="highlight">Real Time First Person Experience</span> on impossible mode, and makes it a <span class="highlight">Turn Based Strategy Experience</span>. It's a tutorial that begins at entering your name and saying hello, and carries you to understand complex German in use, and to effortlessly expand your vocabulary without taking notes or forcing your will to do something unmotivating like grinding out cards over and over.</p>

            <p>So, how did I go about it?</p>


            <h2>The Engine</h2>
            <p>I downloaded a spaced repetition program to help me learn German. But something felt off. When I peeked under the hood with Claude, I found a random generation function. Not spaced repetition at all - just shuffled cards.</p>

            <p>So I went down the rabbit hole. I researched how real spaced repetition systems work and discovered the concept of <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/deck-options.html#ease-factor" target="_blank">ease factor</a> - the multiplier that determines when you see a card again. It was elegant, but I thought the Fibonacci sequence could do it better. More predictable intervals. More human-friendly progression.</p>

            <p>I replaced the random function with Fibonacci-based scheduling and built out the card presentation: first the word alone, then a helper sentence, then a translated sentence, then checking the word in context, then notes. Stages of revelation, not a wall of information.</p>

            <p>Then came the <a href="manual/walkthrough/rating.html">rating system</a> - a way for the program to listen to how well you know something and adjust accordingly. It worked. The vocabulary was sticking. But there was a problem.</p>

            <h2>The Interface</h2>
            <p>The whole thing was just text scrolling up the page. I knew the recipe was good - I could feel the words embedding themselves - but when I tried to show anyone else, their eyes glazed over. Unusable. Incomprehensible to anyone but me.</p>

            <p>I knew it worked. I could feel the words sticking. But I couldn't give that to anyone else. The gap between what I had built and what anyone could actually use - this caused me to stop and reassess. I realised if this is going to be useful, it needs to be engaging, and then things started to click.</p>

            <h2>The Boss Fight</h2>
            <p>The purging mechanism came first. When cards reach mastery, they needed somewhere to go. And that's when the boss fight was born.</p>

            <p>I built a system where your vocabulary knowledge becomes a genuine battle - real stakes, real victories. Beat a cluster and those cards leave your rotation forever. You're not grinding. You're winning. <a href="manual/walkthrough/bossfight.html">See how it works →</a></p>

            <h2>The Vibe</h2>
            <p>Then I learned to wipe the screen. Suddenly scrolling text became a flipbook - choose your own adventure. Each screen a single moment. Everything fell into place from there. Then <a href="https://github.com/rhasspy/piper" target="_blank">Piper TTS</a> dropped from the heavens - neural text-to-speech that actually sounds human. The whole thing could speak to you. And through all of it, Claude! A word of appreciation for Claude: While I have a working knowledge of computer science, I cannot code. I don't have the vocabulary. I can reason. I can refer to the function, but I can't get off the first screen without Claude. But, I can describe what I need, and Claude helps me build it. That's vibe coding. That's how this exists. And how it can be so cheap.</p>

            <h2 id="recipe">The Recipe</h2>
            <p><span class="highlight">Fibonacci-based spaced repetition.</span> Cards appear when your brain is ready to see them - not randomly, not on a fixed schedule. The maths works for you.</p>

            <p><span class="highlight">Progressive card purging.</span> Master a cluster and those cards are gone. Your deck shrinks as you grow. No infinite grind.</p>

            <p><span class="highlight">Ramped difficulty.</span> Start with single words. Build to helper sentences. Graduate to full German in context. The complexity scales with your ability.</p>

            <p><span class="highlight">Microlessons.</span> Grammar and pronunciation guidance built into the flow. Learn the rules as you need them, not in a separate textbook.</p>

            <p><span class="highlight">Boss fights.</span> Real stakes. Real victories. Prove your mastery and move forward.</p>

            <p><span class="highlight">Choose your master.</span> Six guides with their own personality and teaching style. They'll be with you the whole way.</p>

            <p><span class="highlight">Runs on anything.</span> Built with a philosophy: if you have a computer, you can learn a language. Third world hardware, decade-old laptops, hobbyist machines - all welcome. Terminal-based, offline-capable, distraction-free. <a href="manual/terminal.html">Learn about caching →</a></p>
