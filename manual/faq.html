            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <h3>What is FlashBoss?</h3>
            <p>FlashBoss is a vocabulary learning application that gamifies the flashcard experience. It uses spaced repetition combined with RPG elements like streaks, boss fights, and progression tiers.</p>

            <h3>How is it different from Anki?</h3>
            <p>FlashBoss is designed to be more engaging and less overwhelming. Instead of managing complex deck settings, you follow a structured path through curated vocabulary tiers. The game mechanics keep you motivated with daily streaks, Drive rewards, and boss encounters.</p>

            <h3>What languages are available?</h3>
            <p>Currently available:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>German Core</strong> - Included with base game</li>
                <li><strong>Esperanto Core</strong> - Included free</li>
                <li><strong>German Pareto 1 &amp; 2</strong> - Available as DLC</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What is Drive?</h3>
            <p>Drive represents saved-up days off. When you complete a Grimoire session, you pull time forward within the sanctum. Your Drive is the difference between sanctum time and reality - essentially, banked rest days.</p>

            <h3>Can I change my master?</h3>
            <p>Yes, you can change masters from the Meet the Masters menu. However, changing masters will adjust your streak requirements and daily card limits to match the new master's difficulty.</p>

            <h3>What happens if I break my streak?</h3>
            <p>Breaking a streak resets your streak counter, but your learned vocabulary and progress through tiers is preserved. Drive can protect you from streak breaks.</p>

            <h3>Is there audio pronunciation?</h3>
            <p>Yes, FlashBoss includes text-to-speech pronunciation for vocabulary. German uses the Piper neural TTS engine. Esperanto uses phonetic transcription through Polish voices.</p>
