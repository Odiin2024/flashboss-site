            <h3>What Are Lessons?</h3>
            <p>Lessons are structured introductions to new vocabulary. Rather than throwing cards at you cold, lessons teach you words in context with explanations, examples, and audio pronunciation.</p>

            <h3>Lesson Structure</h3>
            <p>Each lesson typically covers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A thematic group of related words</li>
                <li>Pronunciation with audio</li>
                <li>Example sentences showing usage</li>
                <li>Grammar notes where relevant</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Unlocking Lessons</h3>
            <p>Lessons become available as you progress through clusters and tiers. Defeating a cluster boss unlocks the lessons for that cluster's vocabulary.</p>

            <h3>After the Lesson</h3>
            <p>Once you complete a lesson, those cards enter your review rotation. You'll see them according to the spaced repetition schedule, reinforcing what you learned.</p>

            <h3>Revisiting Lessons</h3>
            <p>You can revisit any lesson you've unlocked at any time. This is useful if you want to refresh your memory on a particular topic or review the pronunciation of words you're struggling with.</p>
