Review cards come first — work through them until your streak target is met. After that, new cards and any remaining due cards open up. Complete them at your own pace, dipping in and out as many times as you need.\n\nIf you finish everything and want more, the Grimoire pulls tomorrow's cards forward by one day — a bonus session that advances your entire schedule. Progress on your own terms."
