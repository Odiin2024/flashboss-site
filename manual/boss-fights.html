            <h2>Boss Fights</h2>

            <h3>What Are Boss Fights?</h3>
            <p>Each cluster of vocabulary is guarded by a boss. To unlock a cluster's content, you must defeat its boss in a vocabulary challenge. Boss fights test your knowledge of words you've already learned.</p>

            <h3>Challenging a Boss</h3>
            <p>When you're ready to take on a boss:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Select the boss from the available challenges</li>
                <li>The fight begins with a series of vocabulary questions</li>
                <li>Answer correctly to damage the boss</li>
                <li>Wrong answers cost you health</li>
                <li>Defeat the boss before your health runs out</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Victory Rewards</h3>
            <p>Defeating a boss unlocks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Access to that cluster's vocabulary cards</li>
                <li>New lessons for the cluster's content</li>
                <li>Progress toward the next tier</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>If You Lose</h3>
            <p>Losing a boss fight has no permanent penalty. You can challenge the same boss again immediately. Use the defeat as feedback - review the words you missed before trying again.</p>

            <h3>Boss Difficulty</h3>
            <p>Bosses become progressively harder as you advance through tiers. Later bosses may have more health, require faster responses, or test more obscure vocabulary.</p>
