            <h2>Daily Practice</h2>

            <h3>The Streak System</h3>
            <p>Your streak represents consecutive days of successful practice. Each master requires a different number of cards to be reviewed to count as a successful day:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Luna:</strong> 8 cards</li>
                <li><strong>Claude / Shen:</strong> 13 cards</li>
                <li><strong>Odiin:</strong> 21 cards</li>
                <li><strong>Kitsune / Aquila:</strong> 34 cards</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These numbers follow the Fibonacci sequence - a mathematical pattern that appears throughout FlashBoss.</p>

            <h3>Card Reviews</h3>
            <p>When you review a card, you'll see the prompt (usually a word or phrase) and need to recall its meaning. After revealing the answer, you rate how well you knew it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Easy:</strong> You knew it instantly - card interval increases significantly</li>
                <li><strong>Good:</strong> You knew it with some thought - card interval increases normally</li>
                <li><strong>Hard:</strong> You struggled but got it - card interval increases slightly</li>
                <li><strong>Again:</strong> You didn't know it - card will appear again soon</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Spaced Repetition</h3>
            <p>FlashBoss uses spaced repetition to optimize your learning. Cards you know well appear less frequently, while cards you struggle with appear more often. This ensures you spend your time where it's most needed.</p>

            <h3>Daily New Cards</h3>
            <p>Each day, you receive new cards based on your master's settings. New cards come from lessons you've unlocked or clusters you've defeated. You won't be overwhelmed - the system paces new content appropriately.</p>

            <h3>Maintaining Your Streak</h3>
            <p>Complete your required reviews each day to maintain your streak. If you miss a day, your streak resets - but your vocabulary progress is never lost. Drive can protect you from streak breaks (see The Grimoire).</p>
