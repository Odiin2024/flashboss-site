            <h3>The Tier System</h3>
            <p>Vocabulary in FlashBoss is organized into tiers. Each tier represents a level of difficulty or frequency:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tier 1:</strong> Most common, essential vocabulary</li>
                <li><strong>Tier 2:</strong> Common everyday words</li>
                <li><strong>Tier 3:</strong> Intermediate vocabulary</li>
                <li><strong>Tier 4:</strong> Advanced vocabulary</li>
                <li><strong>Tier 5:</strong> Specialized and less common words</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You must complete a tier before advancing to the next one.</p>

            <h3>Clusters Within Tiers</h3>
            <p>Each tier is divided into clusters - thematic groups of related words. For example, a tier might contain clusters for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Numbers and counting</li>
                <li>Colors and descriptions</li>
                <li>Food and drink</li>
                <li>Travel and directions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each cluster has its own boss that must be defeated to unlock the content.</p>

            <h3>Cluster Progression</h3>
            <p>Within a tier, you can tackle clusters in any order. However, you must defeat all cluster bosses in a tier before the next tier unlocks.</p>

            <h3>Virgin Day</h3>
            <p>When you first enter a new tier, that day becomes your "virgin day" for that tier. Completing all requirements on your virgin day is a special achievement.</p>

            <h3>Tier Completion</h3>
            <p>A tier is complete when:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All cluster bosses are defeated</li>
                <li>All vocabulary is in your review rotation</li>
                <li>You've demonstrated mastery of the content</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Completing a tier unlocks the next tier and is marked as an achievement in your profile.</p>
